                      <p class="mb-30">It probably takes you days of work to earn enough to buy an iPhone. But if you’re Apple, it takes just a fraction of a second. Top tech companies are making money at a stunning rate. 
                      Software company Tipalt examined how much money 50 companies from the Fortune 500 pull in as annual profit to determine which firms make the most money per second. Tech-centric companies dominate the list.
                       Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google) are in the top three, taking in $1,752, $1,244, and $1,089 per second, respectively. That translates to $151 billion, $108 billion, and $94 billion a day. A little 
                       farther down at number 6 is Facebook, making $586 per second. </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">AT&T and Comcast—not identified as technology companies on this list, but rather as telecom—appear in the eighth and ninth spots with $441 and $414 per second. And Amazon makes the list as
                         well at number 10, earning $367 every second, though it’s categorized as a retail company. </p>
                      <blockquote>Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic. -Arthur C. Clarke</blockquote>
                      <p class="mb-30">Tipalt gives the tech sector second place when it comes to profit, behind food and beverages and ahead of telecommunications, financials, and healthcare. But if you categorize AT&T, Comcast,
                         and Amazon as tech (and we do), then it’s clearly the most profitable sector in the Fortune 500. This doesn’t go for everyone though.
                      Some companies are losing money every second. GameStop is not the stonk to buy, since the company loses $15 each second. And Tesla is speeding away from profitability, losing $27 per second. Yet it might
                       never catch up to Uber, which has never turned a profit and loses $270 per second.</p>
